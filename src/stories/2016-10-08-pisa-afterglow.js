        <StoryIntro>
          When I close my eyes and visualize our time in Italy, I see everything in slow-motion.
          It&apos;s definitely a place that I am in love with. Falling in love with a place it&apos;s a unique
          feeling, it is a constant desire for more, more of the beautiful skylines, sunrises,
          sunsets, delicious food, different culture and new adventures. And the more you take in,
          the deeper you fall and the more you wish to see. It all started with Rome, continued with
          Venice, then mesmerizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. Now
          it is time for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa">Pisa</a>, a small and enchanting
          city in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany">Tuscany</a>.

        <StoryTextBlock>
          Yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa">Leaning Tower</a> is
          spectacular — even more so in person than in pictures and has
          made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa">Pisa</a> famous all over the world, but
          there’s much more to Pisa than that. The medieval city boasts of 11th century gorgeous
          art, like the elaborate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_Baptistery">Baptistery</a> and
          other beautiful palaces. Most of them are in the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_dei_Miracoli">Square
          of Miracles (Piazza dei Miracoli)</a>. The square is surrounded by a beautiful green
          lawn where tourists lie down and relax admiring the amazing setting.

          The Leaning Tower has made Pisa famous all over the world, but in addition
          to the amazing Square of Miracles, the city offers many other beautiful
          places to see. Here are some for inspiration.
