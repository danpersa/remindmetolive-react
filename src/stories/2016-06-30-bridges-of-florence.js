        <StoryIntro>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_River">Arno River</a> naturally
          splits <Link to="/stories/florence-theme-park-of-renaissance.html">Florence</Link> in
          two sides. It's now surprise that the two sides of the city are linked
          through bridges. What's interesting is how beautiful most of the bridges
          are and the way they dominate Florence's cityscape.

          I took the next photo from the Michelangelo Square. From here you can
          have a nice overview of the bridges. The colorful Ponte Vecchio is the
          first in line, followed by the others.

        <StoryTextBlock title="Ponte Vecchio">
          The most iconic bridge in Florence is Ponte Vecchio, the Old Bridge.
          This bridge is always really crowded, from far away looks like there is perpetual party.
          What's really happening is that the mass of tourists wants to take selfies
          with the river and the next bridges. There is also a market on the bridge,
          where you can buy luxury goods, like jewelry and expensive watches.

        <StoryTextBlock title="Ponte Santa Trinita">
          The Ponte Santa Trìnita (The Holy Trinity Bridge) is the oldest elliptic
          arch bridge in the world, the three flattened ellipses giving the structure
          its celebrated elegant appearance. This bridge is the most central one.
          We stopped here many times to eat ice cream and admire the river and the other
          bridges.
