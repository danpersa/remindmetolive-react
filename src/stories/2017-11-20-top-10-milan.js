        <StoryIntro>
           A few weeks ago, I had the unique chance to visit Milan. I did
           a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdJ_-4v2CzE">tech talk</a> here,
           at the Codemotion conference and I had a few hours to go around the city.

           As my time here was limited, I had to prioritize what I want to visit. Here are
           my top 10 favorite places in Milan.
        </StoryIntro>

        <StoryTextBlock title="The Milan Cathedral">
          The Milan Cathedral, (Duomo di Milano) is located in in the center of the city.
          It&apos;s built in the Gothic style and took nearly six centuries to complete.
          It is the largest church in Italy and the third largest in the world.
          Looking at the tall arches and towers you get a religious feeling of greatness,
          as everything points upwards to the skies and god.
